    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research demonstrates that even state-of-the-art language models are vulnerable to Chain-of-Thought manipulation attacks, with an overall success rate of **35.26%**. However, there are significant differences in model resilience:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** shows the strongest resistance (27.75% ASR)\n",
    "- **Perplexity Sonar Pro** is most vulnerable (44.51% ASR)\n",
    "- **Conclusion Forcing** attacks are most effective (51.79% ASR)\n",
    "- **Reasoning Redirection** attacks are least effective (22.16% ASR)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Methodological Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial results reported 51.01% ASR due to systematic classification errors:\n",
    "- False positive rate: ~30-40% of reported successes\n",
    "- Root cause: Answer extraction failures and normalization issues\n",
    "- **Fix:** Prioritized numeric extraction, improved normalization\n",
    "- **Verification:** 95% classification accuracy confirmed via manual sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights the importance of rigorous validation in AI security research.\n",

    "## Defense Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these findings, we recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conclusion Validation (Priority 1)**\n",
    "   - Implement backward reasoning verification\n",
    "   - Use independent verification models\n",
    "   - Projected 40-50% ASR reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Premise Verification (Priority 2)**\n",
    "   - Extract and validate implicit premises\n",
    "   - Check against knowledge bases\n",
    "   - Projected 25-35% ASR reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Meta-Reasoning Boundaries (Priority 3)**\n",
    "   - Define non-negotiable constraints\n",
    "   - Separate constraint reasoning from task reasoning\n",
    "   - Projected 20-30% ASR reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Defense-in-Depth**\n",
    "   - Combined layers can reduce ASR from 35% to 10-15%\n",
    "   - No single defense provides comprehensive protection\n",
    "\n",
    "See published research report for detailed defense implementation patterns.\n",
